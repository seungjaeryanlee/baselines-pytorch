# Contributor Guide

**NOTE: This document is a Work In Progress (WIP). If you have any suggestions for improvements or find missing information, don't hesitate to create an issue!**

Thank you for considering contributing to `baselines`! We can use every bit of help :)

For now, please leave an issue if you are interested in helping out.

## Code Style

### `flake8`

We use `flake8` to maintain consistent code style. Install it through `pip`:

```
pip install flake8
```

Try running `flake8` on root repo directory. The program should terminate without any output.

```
flake8
```

`flake8` checks Python files and tells you if there are inconsistencies with PEP8 code style. No output means that the codebase is consistent with PEP8, and that's how we want it to be :)

### `autopep8`

While developing, it is easy (and often beneficial) to deviate from the strict code style momentarily. However, when we try to commit, it can become a burden to enforce code style. This is when `autopep8` comes in: it tries to change the code to adhere to PEP8. Install it through `pip`:

```
pip install autopep8
```

To run autopep8, you need to specify a file. For example, if you want to use `autopep8` to `main.py`:

```
autopep8 main.py
```

This will output an "better" version of main.py to output. We probably want to put changes in-place, so we add a flag:

```
autopep8 main.py --in-place
```
